# select-woo
Example code showing how to implement the [selectWoo](https://developer.woocommerce.com/2017/08/08/selectwoo-an-accessible-replacement-for-select2/) JavaScript function on a select element.

This code is designed to work as a UI device to add a product posts selector on new post / post edit screens within WordPress' WP Admin system. The code is documented and should make sense!
